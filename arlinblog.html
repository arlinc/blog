        <h2>Update!</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I am back! Have not updated the old blog in a few weeks. Been busy with work and life. Also have been putting in a lot of time coding! Working with my brother Ryan doing an intership at his company Daytum a few times a week has been awesome and I'm learning a lot. Still working online with Khan Academy and Udemy, also added SoloLearn into my online coding rotation. SoloLearn has some good overview that has been helpful for me. I'm currently stuck on Khan with some more advanced JS stuff, but honestly have been focusing most of my time on Udemy and working with Ryan.
            I also would like to actually get this blog online, and hopefully add some pictures and some work I have done / am doing as sort of an online resume.
            </p>

        <h2>Setup...</h2>
        
        
        <p>Spent a few hours with my brother today trying to set up my machine. We ran into some issues since he is on Mac and I currecntly have a PC. We focused on setting up Git, GitHub, Npm, windows CMD prompt and Firebase. Ryan and I talked about coding - and learning the actual code. We also tlaked about the setup and getting all the required programs set up. I will post more detailed instructions on how we got this all set up soon.
        <p>I finished the HTML / CSS class on Khan yesterday! I'm now starting the SQL class on there and learning about databases. 
        <div id ="git"><img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/avatars/avatar-team.png">Check out Git and GitHub - really cool. I'm just starting to learn what it can do - but its a lot!</div>

        <h2>First work day with Ryan!</h2>
       
        
        <p>Spent several hours workign with my brother today. It was really awesome! We looked at projects that he is working on now, and went over some introductory stuff, and looked at a rough syllabus for our studies moving forward.    
        <p>Right now I am setting up my PC with Git, Visual studio code, and Npm

        <p>Hi. Just getting home from work... It was a late one, we had our monthly inventory at Whoel Foods. It went pretty well - just takes a while to get everything taken care of and handled in order.  <p>
        I am really enjoying HTML and CSS! CSS really has some amazing potential, I've just been learning about CSS postioin and how powerful and usful that is. I'm over halfway done with the HTML / CSS class on Khan Academy. I have an exciting opportunity to work with and learn from my brother! He is an amazing coder and has years of experience in web and software development. We will be doing a weekly live video session every Sunday since he lives in LA. I will report back tomorro with how it is and what I learned!<p>
